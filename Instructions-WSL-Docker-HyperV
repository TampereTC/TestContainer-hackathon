HACKATHON Setup for WINDOWS 10/Hyper-v with WSL linux subsystem

Instructions how to install Docker for Windows and integrating the same to “Bash on Ubuntu on Windows”.

Why: Natively docker configuration is based on linux file system. On otherhand Hyper-V natively integrated as part of Windows10 OS.
  

1)	Prepare Windows10 settings: Enable Hyper-V and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) 

2)	Install Ubuntu Shell from Microsoft store

3)	Install Docker for Windows. [Download link](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20for%20Windows%20Installer.exe)
4)	Expose the Docker daemon (start Docker or set to “Start Docker automatically when you login into your PC)

5)	Launch WSL (Type Ubuntu on win search box)

$ `sudo apt-get update`
$ sudo apt-get -y upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install -y git docker docker-compose
$ git config --global http.proxy http://10.144.1.10:8080

6)	You need to tell the Docker client (running in WSL) where the Docker host is (on Windows side), and you can do that by using the -H option as follows:

$ docker -H localhost:2375 images

NOTE!
If you don't want to type the host every time, you can set up and environment variable called DOCKER_HOST to localhost:2375

$ export DOCKER_HOST=localhost:2375

7)	Check that all looks ok
$ docker info

8) check the WSL mount to host system
Your windows home is typically mounted under c or d drive. /mnt/c/Users/<user>
Extract your hackathon material here /mnt/c/Users/<user>/hackstack
$ cd /mnt/c/Users/<user>/hackstack

9) Win10 WSL Subsystem is ready to follow further instruction. 
Note that 'sudo' is not working with WSL docker. 
Please run further commands without sudo.
