# HACKATHON Setup for WINDOWS 7 + Docker in Virtualbox

Instructions to setup ready made hackathon env by Virtualbox based VM clone image.  

Why Docker in Virtualbox? 
- No Docker support in Windows 7.
- Ready made VM with full hackathon setup in one package save your time.

Other side of the coin:
- From docker performance point of view. Docker VM inside of Virtualbox VM is not ideal solution.
- Mounting volumes via office OS host will be tricky. 

## Configuration:

Instructions are covering Virtualbox installation + VM clone image related settings.
